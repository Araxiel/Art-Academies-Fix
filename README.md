# Art Academies Fix

After a recent vanilla 1.2.* patch, Art Academies' profitability went through the roof, leading to private investment (and AI governments) spamming Art Academies.
This little mod addresses that.

It does essentially four things:
 - Increases the output of Fine Art, greatly increasing supply and bringing down the Fine Art price.
 - Vastly increases and diversifies the input goods requirements of Art Academies, this decreases profitability.
 - Increases Art Academies employment, further bringing down profitability and adding some waged non-shareholder pops to the Arc Academy.
 - Ever, ever so slightly gives Services a bit more weight to satisfy the Art need.
